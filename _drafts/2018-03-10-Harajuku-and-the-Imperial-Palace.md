Harajuku has one of my favorite foods in the world: cheesecake, ice cream, whipped cream, and fruit stuffed crepes wrapped into a cone. Normally I don't like sweets, but there's something about this sugar trap that leaves me craving it long after I leave Japan. After beelining it to Takeshita-Dori for my weakness, Miranda and I wandered through the brightly colored stores blasting JPop. We stopped in a Purikura to take some awkward pictures and of course visited a cat cafe. Tucked discreetly behind Harajuku, Meiji Shrine lies under a blanket of green. It's a jarring experience going from the loud, flashing lights of Harajuku to the Meiji grounds. The temperature drops below the trees and large Toriis line the pathways. We didn't have much time to explore though so we promise to come back.

Still in Harajuku, we meet with one of my cousins that I haven't seen since I was 14 and she was 7. Juuna, my mom's cousin's kid, wants to go to college in Los Angeles and is obviously serious about her English studies. Even though it's been 10 years since we saw each other (and she doesn't even remember that!), there's a level of comfort I always feel with my family here. It doesn't seem to matter how little I see them, or if we've never even met before, they're always so nice and interested. I hope one day they will visit Los Angeles so I can return the kindness. Afterwards, Miranda and I head to dinner for what feels like a 20 course meal of tempura with Uncle Mori and Aunt Keiko. Completely stuffed, Miranda falls asleep on the couch while I desparetly try to finish my homework.
