        <title>Final Days on the South Island</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My last full day of adventure on the southern island started with a trip to the peninsula seal colony in Kaikoura. You can walk right up to the seals, although you do need to give them 10 meters of personal space. I decided to pass on any other activities in the area and opted to do a drive inland to some promising hot springs in Hanmer Springs. It was a long scenic drive in - the last one of my trip. The hot springs themselves were more like a water amusement park, complete with a water slide and lazy river. They had several different large pools to choose from but the place was extremely packed. I had forgotten it was the Saturday of Easter weekend and the weather was clear and warm too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/c7pGjuXl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Seal Peninsula&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SVRjdadl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my escape from the bustling town I headed to my campsite, 50 minutes from Christchurch and on a tall cliff overlooking the ocean and city down below. These past two weeks of camping have really tested my skills. Freezing temperatures, rain, and heavy wind; all things I haven’t had to really deal with camping in the States. I learned I don’t know how to tie down my tent or even tie a proper knot. My tent nearly came apart on me in Lake Wanaka and two days of rain in the Milford Sound left everything soaking wet. I found out the limits of my hiking skills after losing the trail on one advanced hike led to a scary fall. I’ve been camping and hiking and playing in the desert since I was a baby in arms, but this trip has shown me where I need improvement. I’m no survivalist, but I definitely thought I’d do better in the rain and cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vXYI3STl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GcurLEPl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Camping at Godley Head&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easter stomped all over the plans I had for my final morning in Christchurch. I managed to get my car washed, but laundry and souvenir shopping would have to wait. After a quick hour and a half flight, I was in the Auckland in the North Island and a whole world away from the South Island. New Zealand’s most metropolitan city, I could’ve been wandering the streets of Seattle. Here I’ll be staying in an Air BnB just a 20 minute bus ride from the city center. As I walked the streets of downtown, I wondered what I would do with my 3 days here. Honestly I just felt like sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sandy Beaches and the North Coast</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I made a sketchy escape from the muddy campsite that had trapped a camper van the night before and headed towards Tanaka and the Golden Bay. When I arrived I found out that the road to Tanaka was closed until 3, so I decided to go to Abel Tasman National Park where one of New Zealand’s Great Walks lies. I choose a cove that would be a 9 mile return hike in and headed out. Unlike some of the hikes I’ve tackled, the trail was wide and well worn in. It followed the cliff side through the temperate rainforest and gave beautiful views of the ocean, islands, and white sand bays. When I got to my destination, the beach had only a few other people and a couple of seagulls. I ended up staying longer than I meant to, almost falling asleep in the sand enjoying the warm weather. By the time I made it back to my car, the 3 hours it would take to get to Tanaka no longer seemed worth it. I had wanted to see Te Waikoropupu Springs which boasts some of the clearest water in the world, but honestly I’ve been pretty impressed with the lakes I’ve seen already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oqR4RpCl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cove at the end of the hike&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cxUvw3rl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Abel Tasman Park&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made my way to Nelson and Tahunanai Beach, where I laid down a towel on the white sands and tried decide what to do the following day. This is probably one of the few nights I’ve stopped driving earlier than an hour before sunset, and it was nice to relax. I was starting to feel I probably could have spent my whole trip lounging on the sandy, warm beaches of the north coast. I choose a campsite right in front of the beach and enjoyed a beautiful sunset while I ate my dinner. After talking with my neighbor from Colorado about fishing and my favorite hiking tracks I turned in for an early night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zM5PjjPl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Not a bad view&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I had dreams of sleeping in, the airport in Nelson had flights coming in by 7. I packed up and headed out to Picton and the Marlborough Sounds. In Picton, the landing point of ferries from the North islands, I went to an aquarium with a blue penguin rehabilitation program. EcoWorld Aquarium was, well, a little sad. The tanks were small and dirty. The Blue Penguin they currently had spent the majority of the time with its head tucked in the corner of the tank he shared with random fish. A preserved giant squid sat awkwardly in what I would guess is a tank of formaldehyde in the dimly lit room. It was very underwhelming and I felt bad for the poor fish and reptiles stuck there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zLgCSmRl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picton&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/g72LwQ0l.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Marlborough Sounds&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After failing to find a cruise in my price range or a hike I was interested in, I headed down Queen Charlotte Drive that’s lined with viewpoints to look out at the sounds from the cliffsides. Since I had time to kill, I made a detour down one of the peninsula’s windy roads to a seemingly deserted resort. The barista in the cafe told me that a lot of their customers come from the nearby Queen Charlotte Track. I enjoyed my flat white with a view of the green and empty bay before making my way back to the main highway. An earthquake in 2016 devastated the highway down the east coast to Christchurch. It’s now only open during the day, and it is a very slow drive down an uneven and unsealed road. I wasn’t able to stop because of the construction, but I did get to see colonies of seals hanging out along the coastline. I ended up at a crowded campsite just south of Kaikoura on a beach with black sands and a spot for my tent where I could hear the crashing waves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fshep5sl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;More shots of the sound&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/q5f4PMPl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cotton Candy Sunset&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to believe that my time in the South Island is almost over. I’m sad that I’ll no longer wake up to the sight of clouds hanging in the mountains. No more picturesque, pastel sunsets over the ocean. No setting up my tent every night or packing it up every morning. I’ll miss the green hills filled with farms and the never ending rainforests covering the mountains. Falling asleep to the sound of a river or the ocean or even better, silence. It’ll be hard to adjust to days that are filled with more than driving and hiking. But my bed next to the noisy freeway is calling me home.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rainy Days on the West Coast</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had planned to do the Rob Roy track, supposedly one of the best day walks in Southern New Zealand, but when I woke up it was cold, windy, and threatening rain. Instead I spent the morning doing laundry and taking advantage of the unlimited WiFi at the restaurant where I was staying. WiFi here is very different than in the States. It tends to be super slow and even the places the place where you pay for it, you only get a certain amount, like 300 MB. After a very slow start to my morning, I began my leisurely drive over Haast’s Pass to the glaciers on the West Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4k2P9rMl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Waterfalls along the way&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/A9TE6ixl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blue Pools&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say leisurely, I mean I really took my time. I stopped at almost every spot with a little camera sign. I even took a 50 mile detour to go down to Jack’s Bay, a secluded “town” south of Haast. The hours behind the wheel gave me time to contemplate the, at times, overwhelming natural beauty of New Zealand. I know that sounds dramatic, but if nature has never left you breathless, maybe you need to go out and do some more exploring. The feeling comes from awe at the earth and how it formed and how it’s survived and adapated and overcome. It’s appreciation for the people who roamed these thick forests and mountains before airplanes and cars and roads existed. It’s gratefulness that I live at a time when it is so accessible, and I can be here thousands and thousands of miles from my home and experience it. It’s anger at how we destroy and pollute the earth but insist that we don’t. It’s that moment when you’re alone in a forest and everything is covered in green, and the birds are singing, and the crickets are chirping, and for one little second you can almost hear the plants breathing. I’ve felt it before and I know I’ll feel it again, because it’s why I’m here, it’s why I travel, it’s why I camp, it’s to listen to the earth’s heartbeat and remember how very small I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CITnn7jl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The trees are alive&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eq7zmW8l.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;More photo ops&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I made it to Fox Glacier, it was nearing six with no hope of squeezing in a small hike. I found a (expensive) spot right in town, and a secluded place to pitch my tent. Maybe a little too far into the rainforest because when I returned from making a dinner I caught a curious Kea trying to open the rainfly. The hostel/campground offered a guided hike to see some glow worms and it was truly magical. I decided to do a second lap of the loop to take some long exposure pictures without the crowd and found it to be not only pointless, but terrifying. There’s nothing like being alone in a rainforest in the pitch black to get your heart rate up. To finish off my spooky night as I was getting ready to crawl into my sleeping bag I spotted huge cricket creeping up the INSIDE of my tent. After a thorough check of bedding and the tent for holes, I determined he must have hopped in when I accidentally left the door open earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aBhFwvvl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rainforest spot&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pZRlKLFl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Glow worms&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up to the sound of rain on my tent and Keas calling nearby. After a hearty breakfast, I made an attempt to do the walk to the terminal face of Fox Glacier only to find the trail closed and no view of the glacier due to the clouds. Slightly disappointed, I made my way to Franz Josef Glacier only 30 minutes north. I decided I’d try to wait out the rain soaking in the glacier hot pools. Nothing really beats hanging out in an outdoor spa while it’s raining, especially after a week and a half of camping and hiking. The skies really opened up as time went on and I eventually made it back to my car when my fingertips felt like raisins. As the days go on, I have to be more cognizant of the time I have to get back to Christchurch. I would have liked to stay another day and wait for the rain to clear, but that would mean not being able to see the North Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZYhk69Hl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Glacier Hot Pools&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completely gave up on the glacier and started a crawling drive up north in some of the worst rain I’ve seen in a long time. Clouds blocked the sun, and the rain was really drumming down, but for some reason motorhomes were still whipping around 25 kph turns like they were in a sportscar. Outside of a stop in Hokita, a small twon with lots of crafts shops, I drove straight through to Greymouth. By the time I reached the small coastal city, I had my heart set on a warm, dry bed and found one at Noah’s Ark Backpackers. For only $10 NZD more than a campsite, I wouldn’t have to spend the night in a wet tent or the next day trying to dry said tent in my car. It (theoretically) gave me time to complete some homework and visit the nearby Monteith’s brewery. Sounded like a good deal to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yQFlhxel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Monteith's&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1hPKJial.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sunset in Greymouth&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeling refreshed after my first night in a real bed in a week and a half, I continued my drive up the west coast. After a quick stop at the pancake rocks, I made my way to Fox River to attempt the hike to fox river cave. A local informed the Track was closed but encouraged me to do it anyways. It was a nice hike and the cave was impressive. However because I was alone I decided not to actually enter the cave, partially from fear of the dark, partially for my own safety. On my way back, karma caught up to me for entering the closed trail and I slipped and stuck my hand and knee into the poisonous Ongaonga. After the initial painful, stinging wore off, my hand was left numb for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0ByxGgYl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pancake Rocks&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xuKktDKl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fox River Cave&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ajQC9Mzl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Relaxing after the Fox River hike&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a late lunch on the beach, I continued my drive up the west coast through the rainforest and sandy beaches before cutting inland and making my way towards Abel Tasman Park. I made a stop at Buller Gorge Swing Bridge in the middle of nowhere and had the opportunity to zip line across the river (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmdDpaBzGzo&quot;&gt;Video of Zipline&lt;/a&gt;). I camped out in the free Alexander Bluff Road Reserve where I repeated one of my Dads favorite backpacking stories and dumped my pasta on the ground while I was straining it. Combined with losing some pasta when I accidentally ripped open the bag, I no longer had an issue of having having too much food for the time I had left.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Queenstown and Mount Alfred</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning I completed my drive to Queenstown, the adrenaline junkies dream city, and also perhaps the most expensive city on the Southern Island. Located next to Lake Wakatipu, the sky is filled with paragliders, helicopters, and airplanes taking off from the local airport. I’m beginning to find most New Zealand activities to be out of my budget. Sure I’d love to skydive over a glacier or see a wild kiwi, but these things cost hundreds of dollars. At $99 NZD, kayaking will most likely be my most expensive activity. When I return home I’ll still be unemployed, this trip is coming completely out of my savings. Fortunately, New Zealand’s natural beauty can still be enjoyed for a low cost with a hiking/camping combo and a careful selection of activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5IzemX4l.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The black sheep&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IE0UL4tl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drive from Queenstown to Wanaka&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did when I arrived in Queenstown was take the hike up Queenstown Hill, which is definitely worth going up if you ever find yourself in the area. It was a quick hour and a half hike, but offered a 360 degree view of the city, lake, and surrounding areas. Afterwards, I met up with Kat, my roommate from Christchurch and we checked out the Kiwi Birdlife Park together. I might not be able to swing Stewart’s Island, but for $49 NZD I could see the Kiwis involved in this center’s hatch and release program. Once dominating the islands, the kiwi populations face similar threats of habitat loss and introduced predators that endagered species struggle with across the world. The program in Queenstown focuses on breeding and releasing the Kiwis back into the wild when they can fend for themselves and have a better chance of survival. They explained that baby Kiwis are large when they hatch and basically left alone by the parents. In addition to Kiwis, they had a number of other endagered birds unique to New Zealand and a few of a very special lizard, Tuatara. The Tuatara are the only remaining animals around from the age of the dinosaurs, and believed to live up to 100 years. They also did a fun conservation show introducing and explaining the threats to several different types of New Zealand bird that they flew over the audience’s heads, to the horror of Kat who’s afraid of birds. After a touch of souvenir shopping I made my way to Lake Hawea about an hour away where I would spend the next two nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dgXO31xl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;View from Queenstown Hill&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aYStt7Ql.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tuatara&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Bav8fEyl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cute owl&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day I woke up bright and early for the estimated 5 -7 hour hike up Mount Alfred, located an hour out of Queenstown. It started as steady switchbacks, before turning into a straight, uphill climb for the last 45 minutes. Unfortunately, you can no longer reach the summit because it’s on private land, but it’s still worth it for the workout. After heading back to the city for some more souvenir shopping, I made my way back to Wanaka and it’s famous tree. The willow tree standing in the middle of water is known worldwide as THAT wanaka tree. I hoped to catch it as the sun set, and I was definitely not the only person with that idea. The sunset was a bit of a letdown color wise, but I still got some nice pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Milford Sound Days 2 and 3</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We awoke to find the steady downpour the night before had left the surrounding mountains snow capped, but finally the rain had stopped. Nick and I parted ways and I slowly made my way to the Milford Sound. With the weather clearer, but much colder, I was able to fully appreciate all the viewpoints I had skipped the day before. I even got the opportunity to see a Kea, the only alpine parrot in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QrBeGlsl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kea!&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ctWbQtkl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I finally got to the Milford Sound I hopped in a kayak for a guided paddle and walk of the Milford Track. The kayak portion was much shorter than I would have liked, but the Milford Track was what I was really looking forward to. We walked the last 5 km of the 4 day tramp to the Giants Gate Falls and Lake . While we were walking the clouds finally cleared and we caught a dark pink, orange sunset over the bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VzQdiwll.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kayaking in a rainforest&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/U9jRYQzl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Park of the Kayak Hike&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7p3Kb7El.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Giant's Gate&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final day in Fiordland started at 7 AM with a frozen tent and an early cruise of the Milford Sound. I am extremely thankful that I picked up the comforter because my  sleeping bag would definitely not have been enough in the below freezing temps. The cruise gave me a full view of the fjord I’ve been eyeing for the past few days. Including some dips under waterfalls, we got to see some seals and dolphins playing in front of the boat. I’m glad I held off until the last day for the cruise because despite being incredibly cold, it was the clearest I’ve seen it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Si83n1bl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mountains behind Lake Gunn&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/q8Ouwm8l.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dolphins!&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/olwwi1Hl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sun shining on the Milford Sound&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards I headed to Gertrude’s Saddle, one of the most difficult hikes I’ve been on in a while. Fortunately I met a young boy from Switzerland near the bottom of the hike who was also looking for a hiking buddy as this was not a hike I wanted to do alone. It took a little over an hour to make it to Black Lake, and another 45 minutes to Gertrude’s Saddle. The final part of the hike was a combination of smooth rock with steel ropes to hang on to and giant rocks covered in snow. Jumping from boulder to boulder reminded me of the rocks I grew up playing on in the desert as a kid, but much, much colder. At the top of Gertrude Saddle’s we got a clear view all the way to Milford Sound, and I ran into the best friends from Germany from camping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ojSQvXcl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sample of the hike&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZAld5g3l.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Black Lake&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XA9F32Nl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gertrude's Saddle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a tedious hike back down with the girls, which was almost scarier than the way up, I hopped in my car and said goodbye to Milford Sound. I camped on a farm halfway between Te Anau and Queenstown where I got a much needed shower and washing machine.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Milford Sound</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I woke up early and packed my tent in the dark and rain and finished the trip to the Milford Sound. The campsite was first come first serve, so I thought I needed to arrive early, but I’ve learned campsites here don’t fill up like they do in California. Even if they are full, people just find a place to park and nobody seems to care. I’ve heard the drive in is beautiful, but it was so dark and rainy, I could barely see anything. After setting up at a camp about an hour from the Milford Sound, I finished the drive in. The clouds hung on the massive mountains that were covered in trees and waterfalls that rose on either side of the road. The rivers, overloaded with rain water, gushed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lPnzTWyl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/X8LA1t8l.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Roadside Waterfall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual Milford Sound was gorgeous as well, although I knew I could only get a small glimpse from where I was on the docks. The rain finally let up around 1, and I ran into for the third time the same traveler from Moreaki Boulders. He was going on a cruise and I was going on a hike, but he said he would camp at the same spot as me. I made my way to Lake Marian, a three hour round trip hike to a lake high in the mountains. It was much more difficult than I thought it would be, the path was hard to follow, steep, and involved climbing over rocks and through the roots of trees. The hike throught the rainforest was well worth it, as the glacial lake was completely secluded and the same beautiful blue I’ve been seeing at all the lakes here. I’m running out of words to describe just how gorgeous New Zealand is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bd7zrMsl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;River beside Lake Marian Track&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/J3bkaoKl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lake Marian&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I returned to the campsite it started raining again and wind picked up so we went to a sheltered cooking area where a bunch of campers had gathered to make dinner. Here I got something I’ve been missing this trip. Since I’ve started camping, I’ve only had real conversations with two or three people, and one of those people is Nick who I kept running into. While I like being alone, especially the quiet that allows to enjoy nature, I also love meeting people and hearing their stories. Nick is an organic chemist turned star expert who sailed here from Australia, and was planning to sail to a small island in Asia to start his own star gazing/contemplation business off his boat. I met a Polish couple who planned to run the Milford Track, normally a 4 day Trek, in an estimated 12 hours. Two best friends from Germany told us how their mothers swapped taking care of them every two days when they were growing up. The night was filled with laughter and a colliding of cultures. It’s not that I’ve been lonely, but one of my favorite things about traveling is getting little glimpse of peoples lives from all over the world. It brings out an outgoing side of me that’s normally hidden at home. Perhaps it’s the freedom of knowing that I’ll only be a part of these people’s lives for a day at most, perhaps it’s a magical power only activated by leaving the country.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>East and South Coasts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent the day Monday making my way down the South Coast to the Catlins hoping to catch the Southern Lights. After a walk to view where the Waitaki River meets the ocean, I made my way to Moeraki Boulders, smooth, round naturally created boulders on the coast. There were a lot of people there and some sort of event for kids it seemed, but they were still cool to see. I’ve been pretty cold at night so I made a stop to buy a comforter from Salvation Army which ended up costing a whole $12. Afterwards I headed to Tunnel Beach Walkway where arches are formed by the ocean near Dunedin. The high, tan cliffs stood in stark contrast to the light blue sea crashing below. I was able to drop down all the way to the shore, but it was a strenuous hike back up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ubGevsql.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Reminders to myself&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LmU7Qvdl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;River meeting ocean&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XnzPhHjl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tunnel Beach&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive down the coast was beautiful, full of views of the sea, rainforests, and lots of green hills filled with farms. An abundance of sheep farms.
Tawanui campground was far off the beaten path and recommended to me by another traveler at Moreaki Boulders. Right next to a river, there were only two other people at the campsite. The drive into it was through a bright green valley with more cows and sheeps wandering the hills. As much as I love camping, this sort of remote camping can get kind of scary. Mostly it’s just my mind playing tricks on me, but I did keep hearing some sort of large animal making noises all night. It could also just have been my neighbor snoring but who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/D473pKrl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Moreaki Boulders&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0YhsUtAl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say the early bird gets the worm, and I can tell you that I have never gotten the worm and rarely even make it for breakfast. I went to bed with every intention of waking up at 5:30 and making it Te Anau, but my newly acquired comforter made my tent a little too cozy and I ended up not getting up until 8. I still left camp before 9 though so I was pretty happy with that. Knowing I wouldn’t make it to Te Anau anymore, I took the scenic route to Fiordland making a stop at Cathedral Caverns, one of the 30 longest sea caves in the world. I also stopped at Curio Bay hoping to get a glimpse of some sea lions but instead I ended up running into the same traveler from Moreaki Boulders. Afterwards, I hit what I thought would be a straight 4 hour drive to the South Arm campsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bRLhtzol.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beach at Cathedral Caves&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/f4lOsxAl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cathedral Caves&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GhxM1OIl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Curio Bay&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I reached Fiordland it was dumping rain and I had a 30 mile drive on a dirt road to the secluded campsite. The drive was magical, filled with mountains full of rainforests and roadside waterfalls, but 10 miles from the campsite one of those waterfalls had obliterated the road. I had to turn around and go back to the nearest campsite, an hour and half away. I set up my tent and cooked in the pouring rain, and because of Murphy’s law, the rain stopped as I was sitting in my car eating ramen. I can’t complain about the campsite though, it was free and right next to Lake Monowait. I found most of my stuff has lived up to its waterproofness, although the tent did get pretty wet before I was able to put the rainfly over it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lake Pukaki and Mt Cook</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I woke up cold and wet, even though I ended up putting the rainfly on in the middle of the night. I have to pack up everything wet and take off without even making breakfast. I’m immediately greeted with beautiful views of Lake Tekapo that I had missed the night before, and the terrible realization I’ve been driving on the wrong side of the road for a while. As I make my way towards Mt Cook/Aoraki Park I pass another beautfiul torquiose lake, Lake Pukaki. Most of the drive up to Mt Cook is next to the massive lake, and I couldn’t stop pulling over for pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aANdmkwl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lake Tekapo&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/m88cztBl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lake Pukaki and Mt Cook&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get to Mt Cook, I head for the Hooker Valley Track and I am not let down. It’s a 3 hour hike out and back to Hooker Lake, and it’s definitely one of the most beautiful hikes I’ve ever taken. The path has 3 swinging bridges over raging rivers that are so high up they make me dizzy. If you know me well, you know I have a pretty big fear of heights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SMmuvXil.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Swinging Bridge&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Mme15yVl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Views from the Hike&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4o31RwFl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lunch at Lake Hooker&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hooker Valley, I do a quick hike up to a view of Tasman Glacier, the longest glacier in New Zealand. The glacier is very far away, and a giant lake made of the glacier run off sits at the front of it, a lake that didn’t exsist in 1973. When I finish up in Mt Cook, I start heading towards the coast. I picked up a hitchhiker heading my way who plans on spending the next six months in New Zealand and then another 6 months in Australia! I am so excited/jealous of the people who can stay here for so long, I could definitely spend months exploring. The drive to the coast is lined with cow, sheep, and deer farms and reminds me of driving up the 5 in California, but I’m pretty sure the cows here are happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KH2aGWsl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Finishing the Hike&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/m88cztBl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tasman Glacier and Lake&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nrp2YrYl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drying my Rainfly While I HIke&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had planned on staying in a small farm town, Duntroon, but when I pulled up to the campsite it was totally empty and I got a weird feeling so I decided to drive another 30 minutes to the coast. I’m glad I did because Waitaki Waters has showers, free laundry and WiFi. It’s also a 5 minute walk from the beach so I got to fall asleep to the sound of crashing waves.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Zealand!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One 11 hour flight later, I landed in Christchurch, New Zealand around 5 PM. It feels good to be in a country where I can speak the language and read everything again. My shuttle driver informed me that Christchurch would be crazy the following night for St. Patrick’s Day and I’m tempted to stay another night. However I’ve been city hopping the entire trip and was really looking forward to being able to see the stars again. I stayed in the Jailhouse Hostel, the only hostel I’m planning to stay in this trip. Although Air BnBs have proved the cheapest way to go for a private room(when I’m not camping), hostels are a lot of fun to stay at and a good way to meet people. I shared my room with a girl from San Diego who’s been in New Zealand for two and a half months and is planning to spend the year here. I hit a local pub for some live music, a beer and a big of bowl of potatoes before working on some music and crashing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gs8elWBl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My Room in the Hostel&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZWuKJnHl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Preserved Jail Cell&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CyRAXpZl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I made my way back to the airport after grabbing breakfast at a local coffee co-op with my temporary roommate. I still needed to buy fuel for my stove, some groceries, and a SIM card, pick up the rental car, and turn in my homework before I can leave town. It all takes way longer than I thought it would and it’s almost five by the time I leave Christchurch. I had promised myself I wouldn’t drive at night so I wouldn’t miss out on the gorgeous scenery, and there I was breaking that promise on the first day. Luckily, it didn’t get dark until after eight so I was able to catch some of the rolling green hills and crystal blue water I had seen from the airplane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/60NIB4Jl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Car!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My car is a Japanese car and it took me a long time to figure out just how to play the radio, so I drive with one headphone in which is actually legal here. Driving on the left is weird, but it’s not as difficult as I thought it would be. The hardest places to drive I find are parking lots where there’s no lines separating the sides. I do catch myself driving on the wrong side once after a right turn, but I correct myself pretty quickly. By the time I made it Tapeko, it was pitch black so I took the opportunity to practice some night time photography. With no rain in the forecast, I decide to leave my rainfly off and brave the cold to get a full view of the stars tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ULi5ykul.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;I tried&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, I’m getting more embarrassed here about my lack of knowledge than I did in China or Japan. In a drive thru at KFC, I asked the cashier for french fries instead of chips… which are the same things. At the gas station I asked the attendant if they didn’t have 1 cent coins here and he looked at me like I was dumb. Maybe now that I’m free to ask whatever questions I want with no language barrier, I’m just destined to make a fool of myself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>12 Hours in China</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I woke up before five to make my nine o’clock flight to China before heading to New Zealand. As we fly into Guangzhou, I can’t believe how many apartment buildings and skyscrapers there are pushing right up to farmland. When I arrived I almost go through immigration for locals and then immigration for domestic flights, until someone finally tells me how to apply for a 24 hour visa. After I’m approved, I stood in line behind what appears to be Guangzhou’s soccer team. Airport security walks through the men asking for signatures and taking pictures. When I make it past customs, there’s rows of people in red jerseys waiting for the team to leave the airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out Southern China Airlines provides a free hotel room for travellers with long layovers as well as a tour. I forgo the tour thinking I’ll make it to Canton Tower myself. To my horror, I couldn’t find a currency exchange once I past customs, and nobody seems to understand what I’m asking (because I’m asking in English). I was expecting a Motel 6 kind of deal, but the hotel room is extrememly nice with two beds, a good speaker, and a waterfall showerhead. At this point I’m confused, extremely tired, and penniless. I only have 6 hours left before my shuttle back to the airport, so after chatting with another traveller from Los Angeles, I crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qTlJsb1l.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hotel Room&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8ndy2Mbl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Waterfall Shower!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my well needed nap I headed out armed with my MasterCard for some exploring and food. Unfortunately nobody accepted MasterCard, and even though I resigned myself to using an ATM, I couldn’t find an ATM that would accept Visa either. Maybe they, but everything is in Chinese and I have no idea what I’m doing. I spent the next hours walking the area around the hotel trying to soak up the little time I had left there. The smog is really bad and when the sun sets, lights from city gets stuck and the man made haze turns a sickening orange. I had heard about smog in China, and suffer from it to a degree in Los Angeles as well, but it’s unreal how thick it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pL4htfll.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Smog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a beautiful green park to walk through with a small hill and few ponds filled with lillipads and loud frogs. It’s a nice escape from the honking cars and high rise apartments that line the streets. This is my third city in as many days and life is starting to feel a little a surreal. Just a week and a half ago I was at home cuddled up with my cat and boyfriend and now I’m wandering the streets of a city where I can’t buy any food or speak to anyone. I miss my bed and the comfort of my home, but I’m excited for the upcoming weeks in New Zealand. Although I’m a little bummed I missed seeing the Canton Tower, I learned a valuable lesson about planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kzN7jCpl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ma An Shan Park&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2jFxPOEl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pretty pond&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/A1v4abDl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Random Statue&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final note on China: the Internet censorship. I had heard a little about it, like you can’t use Facebook, but it goes way beyond that. There’s no social media at all, google and it’s products like Google Maps are blocked. Accessing websites from outside China was extrememly slow and oftentimes failed. In order to use the free WiFi in the airport I had to scan my passport to get an access account. I found out the government prevents access to some Wikipedia articles and actively takes down content. I did a little research into how Chinese people feel about the censorship and apparently most of them are fine with it and even support it in some cases. My mom points out that the people answering the surveys might be afraid to speak against the government though. If you’re interested in learning more do some googling of your own (if you’re not in China).&lt;/p&gt;
